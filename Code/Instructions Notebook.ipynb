    "\n",
    "- **The DeepAR_Code Jupyter.ipynb Notebook is the one that has the code for working with the DeepAR code via gluonts library.**\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The MLC_Project_Final_Code.ipynb Jupyter notebook is the one that has the final code for the project using the ARIMA model.**\n",

    "- The data folder contains the dataset. Make sure that the dataset is in the same directory as your code and other module files are present.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure that the New Python notebook you create is of the type **'conda_tensorflow2_p310'**. This is because we need to use TensorFlow for the ARIMA Model.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Installation of Required Packages**:\n",
    "    Before running the code, ensure that you have installed the required packages by executing the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - !pip install tensorflow\n",
    "    - !pip install keras\n",
    "    - !pip install geopandas\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Import Modules**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Upload the .py files for all the modules in the same directory as the notebook and the dataset. Ensure that all the required modules are imported from their respective Python files. The provided code suggests the required imports from different files.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importing Dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The dataset to be analyzed is stored in a CSV file named \"Speed_Camera_Violations.csv\". Ensure that this file is present in the working directory or specify the correct path to the file.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Exploring Dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Execute the code segment under the \"EXPLORING DATASET\" section to explore the dataset. This will load the dataset and display basic information about its structure and content.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing Dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Preprocess the dataset by executing the code segment under the \"PREPROCESSING DATASET\" section. This will clean and preprocess the dataset for further analysis.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Visualizing Dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Visualize the preprocessed dataset by executing the code segment under the \"DATASET VISUALIZATION\" section. This will generate visualizations to gain insights into the dataset.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Splitting Dataset**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets by executing the code segment under the \"SPLITTING DATASET\" section.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Question 1: Predicting Speed Camera Violations**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Determine the optimal parameters for the ARIMA model by executing the code under the \"GETTING THE OPTIMAL PARAMETERS\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Train the ARIMA model with the optimal parameters and forecast violations for a specific address using the \"TRAINING AND FORECASTING WITH OPTIMAL PARAMETERS\" section.\n",
    "    - Optionally, repeat the above steps using random parameters by executing the corresponding code segments.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Question 2: Spatial Patterns of Violations**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Identify spatial clusters of speed camera violations across different addresses by executing the code under the \"RESEARCH QUESTION 2\" section.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Research Question 3: Temporal Variations of Violations**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Explore temporal variations of speed camera violation rates by executing the code under the \"RESEARCH QUESTION 3\" section.\n",
    "</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ARIMA Model Evaluation**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Evaluate the performance of the ARIMA models, both with optimal and random parameters, by executing the corresponding code segments under the \"ARIMA MODEL EVALUATION\" section."
