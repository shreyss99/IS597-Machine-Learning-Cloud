Two different machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine and Random Forest) will be applied to build prediction models using a data set collected from MEDLINE Corpus. Then, these models will be tested using held-out data and the results will be evaluated.  \n",

It contains more than 33 million citations and abstracts of biomedical literature. Since its launch in 1996, PubMed has been maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM), which is located at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

It provides 9 E-utilities (https://dataguide.nlm.nih.gov/eutilities/utilities.html#efetch) that can be used for searching a query in the database. The biopython (https://biopython.org/), a python library specially developed for biological computation, was used to communicate with the NCBI Entrez API for retrieving the query results. Queries were restricted to collect the articles written in English and published in the year of 2019. Records were downloaded in XML files, which were then parsed in python to extract the information needed for processing. The final dataset (\"pubmed_rct.txt\") is a txt file with 50,006 instances and 5 attributes: pmid, rct, year, title, abstract. The column named 'rct' contains the target class which includes either 1 (RCT) or 0 (Non-RCT)."
